Setting up Local WAS for development:

1. Set up RAD + WAS with appropriate updates:
   - RAD 6.0.1.2  (Just use Rational Product Updater to get the latest Fixes)
   - WAS 6.0.2.17 (Current Production Version 20090615)

2. Add new WAS instance to RAD - just follow the default instructions
   - If the WAS instance isn't *clean* (i.e. it contains previously-deployed projects) then you might need to create a new WAS Profile

3. Add Oracle driver to AppServer classpath
   - Download ojdbc14.jar from somewhere (e.g. webvap41)
   - WAS Admin Console: Servers -> Application Servers -> [server1] -> Java and Process Management / Process Definitions -> Java Virtual Machine
     Add JAR's path to classpath
   - Save configuration

4. Add System Properties to AppServer JVM (mocking the _WASPlatform system property populated by the cx-delivery custom service)
   - WAS Admin Console: Servers -> Application Servers -> [server1] -> Java and Process Management / Process Definitions -> Java Virtual Machine -> Custom Properties -> New
     Property Name: _WASPlatform
     Property Value: LOCAL
   - Save configuration

5. Set up STR datasource
   - WAS Admin Console: Resources -> JDBC Providers -> Oracle JDBC Driver -> Data Sources -> New
   - Name: EBSAppDataSource
     JNDI Name: jdbc/EBSAppDataSource
	 URL: jdbc:oracle:thin:@webdbdev:1521:ebst
   - Save configuration

6. Set up Logger Dependencies
   - (*NIX) Add Logger XML files to /repos/prop/logger/[APP_NAME].xml on local disk
   - (WINDOWS) Add Logger XML files to /[Source Folder]/[APP_NAME].xml in project file structure
   - Create the directories as specified in the Logger XML files.

7. Set up properties files
   - (*NIX) Create Directory: /repos/prop/ampartnerportal/
   - (WINDOWS) Create Directory: C:\repos\prop\ampartnerportal\
   - Copy ampartnerportal.properties and clsinterface.properties into the above directory

8. Copy the following Library files from AIX Server (Put them in C: using the same path i.e. C:\repos\...)
   - /repos/javaclass/common/lib/cx-utility.jar
   - /repos/javaclass/common/lib/logger.jar
   - /repos/javaclass/common/lib/str-wrapper.jar
   - /repos/javaclass/common/lib/ext/commons-codec-1.3.jar
   - /repos/javaclass/common/lib/ext/commons-collections-3.1.jar
   - /repos/javaclass/common/lib/ext/commons-httpclient-3.1.jar
   - /repos/javaclass/common/lib/ext/commons-lang-2.4.jar
   - /repos/javaclass/common/lib/ext/commons-validator-1.1.3.jar ***
   - /repos/javaclass/common/lib/ext/jakarta-oro-2.0.8.jar
   - /repos/javaclass/common/lib/ext/log4j-1.2.15.jar
   - /repos/javaclass/common/lib/spring-framework-2.5.6/spring.jar
   - /repos/javaclass/common/lib/spring-framework-2.5.6/spring-webmvc.jar
   - /repos/javaclass/common/lib/xstream-1.3.1/xstream-1.3.1.jar
   - /repos/javaclass/common/lib/xstream-1.3.1/xpp3_min-1.1.4c.jar

9. Set up Shared Library: AM_PARTNERPORTAL_SHARED_LIB
   - WAS Admin Console: Environment -> Shared Libraries -> New
     Name: AM_PARTNERPORTAL_SHARED_LIB
     Description: AM_PARTNERPORTAL_SHARED_LIB
     Classpath:
     /repos/javaclass/common/lib/cx-utility.jar
     /repos/javaclass/common/lib/logger.jar
     /repos/javaclass/common/lib/str-wrapper.jar
     /repos/javaclass/common/lib/ext/commons-codec-1.3.jar
     /repos/javaclass/common/lib/ext/commons-collections-3.1.jar
     /repos/javaclass/common/lib/ext/commons-httpclient-3.1.jar
     /repos/javaclass/common/lib/ext/commons-lang-2.4.jar
     /repos/javaclass/common/lib/ext/commons-validator-1.1.3.jar ***
     /repos/javaclass/common/lib/ext/jakarta-oro-2.0.8.jar
     /repos/javaclass/common/lib/ext/log4j-1.2.15.jar
     /repos/javaclass/common/lib/spring-framework-2.5.6/spring.jar
     /repos/javaclass/common/lib/spring-framework-2.5.6/spring-webmvc.jar
     /repos/javaclass/common/lib/xstream-1.3.1/xstream-1.3.1.jar
     /repos/javaclass/common/lib/xstream-1.3.1/xpp3_min-1.1.4c.jar
     /[workspace directory]/ampartnerportal/WebContent/WEB-INF/classes/   (required for STR in LOCAL Environment)
   - Save configuration

10. Add AM_PARTNERPORTAL_SHARED_LIB Shared Library to ampartnerportal Webapp
    - WAS Admin Console: Applications -> Enterprise Applications -> ampartnerportalEAR -> Libraries -> Add
    - Select AM_PARTNERPORTAL_SHARED_LIB from the drop down list and Apply
    - Save configuration
